# PwrDeauther (V. 2.0)
Automatic MDK3 deauther script. Fast, easy to use and powerful (MDK3 is more powerful than Aireplay).
This script allows you to deauth a specific SSID (Option 1) or an entire channel (Option 2).

## Notes
Some IntelÂ® Hardware In particular Centrino are known to cause problems becuase of the way mdk3 works. 

From the mdk3 documentaion: 
`MDK3 uses the drivers and Injection routines from this project and its predecessor. Thus, all drivers listed there should work with MDK3. (Some special hardware, like Intel Centrino (ipw2200) is NOT supported since they can only inject data, and no management information!)`
