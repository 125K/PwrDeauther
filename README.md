# PwrDeauther
A MDK3 channel deauther script. Fast, easy to use and powerful. (MDK3 is more powerful than Aireplay)

- Do NOT use sudo.

- MDK3 uses the drivers and Injection routines from this project and its predecessor. Thus, all drivers listed there should work with MDK3. <b>(Some special hardware, like Intel Centrino (ipw2200) is NOT supported since they can only inject data, and no management information!)</b>
